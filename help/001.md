## **Authentication App**

<br />

**Authenticator** is an app that generates secure two-factor authentication (2FA) codes for your accounts. When you set up your account with two-factor authentication (2FA), you will receive a secret key to enter into the **Authenticator**, usually the key is in a QR code form. 

<br />

This establishes a secure connection between the **Authenticator** and your account. Once this secure connection is established, the **Authenticator** will generate a 6-8 digit code that is required to access your account. Even, if someone knows your password they still need the 2FA code to access your account.

<br />

Each website has its own guide on how to enable two-factor authentication. For more detailed instructions on how to enable 2FA for your favorite websites, you can visit our [**2FA Guides**](authenticator://guides).
